The Gaming Room - Software Design Document
Project Overview
Client: The Gaming Room  
Project Name: Draw It or Lose It (Expansion)  
Objective: Broaden the present Android-only game and transform it into a web-accessible platform that can be utilized across various devices and operating systems.
Summary of Client Requirements
The Gaming Room aims to broaden access to Draw It or Lose It by moving not just the app but also the game into the web. The new platform must:

- Support multiple teams and players, for a total of up to 64.
- Maintain a singleton so that only one version of the game runs at a time.
- Ensure that all names (game, team, and player) are unique.
- Enforce some sort of round structure, with a guessing mechanism that allows for more or less random hits, depending on how well the guesser is doing.
- Be developed in Java, using best practices, or at least follow some sort of structure that makes it maintainable and understandable.
What Was Done Well in the Documentation?
The documentation had a strength in its clear structure and detailed breakdown of system requirements, constraints, and architecture. It effectively outlined: 
- Design constraints such as memory management, unique identifiers, and platform limitations. 
- Recommended operating system architecture, including cloud-based deployment. 
- Security, including encryption and multi-factor authentication (MFA). 
- Storage and memory management strategies to ensure scalability and reliability.
How the Design Document Helped in Development
A document containing a detailed design provided development with a roadmap, ensuring all team members were on the same page regarding project requirements before any coding took place. The view of the system architecture, in particular, proved useful for visualizing relationships between various components and how data flows through the application. The early definition of constraints also helped avoid rework later in development, which tends to be very costly.
Areas for Improvement
If I were to revise any part of the design document, I would refine the system architecture section to include more diagrams and visual representations. While the document clearly outlines the architecture conceptually, graphical representations (such as UML diagrams or flowcharts) would make it easier to communicate complex interactions.
Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
Grasping the user's needs was pivotal in molding the software's design. We took into account cross-platform accessibility, team-based gaming, and real-time interactions in coming up with what we felt was a pretty seamless user experience—the final product, that is. It is absolutely essential to align the software features with user expectations to maximize uptake and engagement.
Software Design Approach & Future Strategies
In this project, I adopted a structured design approach that encompassed the following key components:

1. Requirement Analysis – In-depth gathering of client requirements.

2. System Architecture Planning – Laying out the main components, their interrelations, and strategies for deployment.

3. Design Constraints Evaluation – Looking into issues of memory, storage, and security.

4. Development Recommendations – Choosing cloud services, frameworks, and protocols that fit the job.

For future projects, I plan to:

- Use Agile methods to permit iteration and the kind of frequent feedback that keeps a project on track.
- Conduct more user testing to validate our design assumptions during the early stages of a project.
- Apply a stronger emphasis on performance optimization, especially as it pertains to web-based applications which must handle variable traffic loads.
Submission Details
The GitHub portfolio repository now includes this project. The manager of this repository can read the software design document and this README file to understand my general approach and my specific thoughts on this project. They will have a solid reference should they ever want to use my work as an example of nicely designed, well-documented code.
