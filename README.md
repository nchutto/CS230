# CS230: Software Design Portfolio – The Gaming Room

##  Project Overview

Client: The Gaming Room  
Project Name: Draw It or Lose It (Expansion)  
Objective: Broaden the present Android-only game into a web-accessible platform usable across various devices and operating systems.



##  Summary of Client Requirements

The Gaming Room aimed to enhance Draw It or Lose It by:
- Supporting multiple teams and players, for a total of up to 64.
- Maintaining a singleton so that only one version of the game runs at a time.
- Ensuring all names (games, teams, and players) are unique.
- Enforcing a guess mechanic for word rounds, with scoring based on accuracy.
- Developing the app in Java (or similar language with strong structure and clarity).
- Addressing platform constraints, including performance, scalability, and memory management.

##  What Was Done Well

The design document:
- Clearly outlined **system requirements**, constraints, and architecture.
- Addressed **memory and storage management**, encryption (e.g., MFA), and platform limitations.
- Structured data and service boundaries for **scalability and reliability**.

---

##  Areas for Improvement

- System architecture diagrams (UML/flowcharts) would improve communication of complex interactions.
- More visual components could enhance collaboration and onboarding for new team members.

---

##  User-Centered Focus

The design aligned with:
- **User needs**, emphasizing **cross-platform accessibility**, real-time multiplayer interactions, and ease of use.
- Features were intentionally designed to maximize **engagement** and **platform consistency**.

---

##  Software Design Approach

This project followed a structured process that included:

1. **Requirement Analysis** – Client-focused needs identification  
2. **System Architecture Planning** – Components, deployment strategies  
3. **Constraint Evaluation** – Performance, memory, security  
4. **Development Recommendations** – Frameworks, tools, and services for delivery

---

##  Future Design Strategies

For future design projects, I aim to:
- ✅ Use **Agile methodologies** for iterative, feedback-driven development
- ✅ Apply **user testing** early to validate assumptions
- ✅ Incorporate **performance optimization**, especially for scalable web applications

##  Submission Note

This portfolio now includes The Gaming Room design document and this `README.md` to showcase my software architecture planning process.  
It serves as a reference for my structured approach to documentation, scalability, and user-centered software design.
